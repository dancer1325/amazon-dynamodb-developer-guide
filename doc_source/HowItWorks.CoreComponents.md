# Core components of Amazon DynamoDB<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents"></a>

* Amazon DynamoDB core components = tables + items + attributes
  * tables
    * == collection (WITHOUT limit) of items
    * data modification events | tables -- can be captured via -- DynamoDB Streams
    * _Example:_ "People" table
  * items
    * == collection of attributes
    * üëÅÔ∏èeach item | table -- is identified uniquely by -- primary keys üëÅÔ∏è
      * üëÅÔ∏è secondary indexes üëÅÔ∏è
        * allows
          * querying each item more flexible
    * _Example:_ "person" is an item | table "people"
  * attributes
    * == fundamental data element / NOT broken down
    * == fields or columns | other DDBB
    * nested attributes
      * == attribute's attribute .....
      * <= 32 levels are possible
    * _Example:_ "PersonId" can be n attribute | "person" item

* _Example1:

```
People      // table / schemaless == attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehand  -> each item can have its own distinct attributes

// next are items       / the primary key is "PersonID"
{
    "PersonID": 101,
    "LastName": "Smith",
    "FirstName": "Fred",
    "Phone": "555-4321"
}

{
    "PersonID": 102,
    "LastName": "Jones",
    "FirstName": "Mary",
    "Address": {
                "Street": "123 Main",

                "State": "OH",
                "ZIPCode": 12345
    }
}

{
    "PersonID": 103,
    "LastName": "Stephens",
    "FirstName": "Howard",
    "Address": {                        // attribute / have nested attribute
                "Street": "123 Main",
                "City": "London",                                    
                "PostalCode": "ER3 5K8"
    },
    "FavoriteColor": "Blue"             // previous items do NOT have this attribute, because the table is schemaless
}
```

* _Example2:_

```
Music   // table    / schemaless

// next are items       / the primary key is Artist & SongTitle     -> distinguishes each item | table vs ALL of the others

## Primary key<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey"></a>

* TODO:
When you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the primary key of the table\. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key\.

DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys:
+ **Partition key** ‚Äì A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the *partition key*\.

  DynamoDB uses the partition key's value as input to an internal hash function\. The output from the hash function determines the partition \(physical storage internal to DynamoDB\) in which the item will be stored\. 

   In a table that has only a partition key, no two items can have the same partition key value\.

  The *People* table described in [Tables, items, and attributes](#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.TablesItemsAttributes) is an example of a table with a simple primary key \(*PersonID*\)\. You can access any item in the *People* table directly by providing the *PersonId* value for that item\.
+ **Partition key and sort key** ‚Äì Referred to as a *composite primary key*, this type of key is composed of two attributes\. The first attribute is the *partition key*, and the second attribute is the *sort key*\.

  DynamoDB uses the partition key value as input to an internal hash function\. The output from the hash function determines the partition \(physical storage internal to DynamoDB\) in which the item will be stored\. All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order by sort key value\.

  In a table that has a partition key and a sort key, it's possible for multiple items to have the same partition key value\. However, those items must have different sort key values\.

  The *Music* table described in [Tables, items, and attributes](#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.TablesItemsAttributes) is an example of a table with a composite primary key \(*Artist* and *SongTitle*\)\. You can access any item in the *Music* table directly, if you provide the *Artist* and *SongTitle* values for that item\.

  A composite primary key gives you additional flexibility when querying data\. For example, if you provide only the value for *Artist*, DynamoDB retrieves all of the songs by that artist\. To retrieve only a subset of songs by a particular artist, you can provide a value for *Artist* along with a range of values for *SongTitle*\.

**Note**  
The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*\. The term *hash attribute* derives from the use of an internal hash function in DynamoDB that evenly distributes data items across partitions, based on their partition key values\.  
The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*\. The term *range attribute* derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value\.

Each primary key attribute must be a scalar \(meaning that it can hold only a single value\)\. The only data types allowed for primary key attributes are string, number, or binary\. There are no such restrictions for other, non\-key attributes\.

## Secondary indexes<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.SecondaryIndexes"></a>

You can create one or more secondary indexes on a table\. A *secondary index* lets you query the data in the table using an alternate key, in addition to queries against the primary key\. DynamoDB doesn't require that you use indexes, but they give your applications more flexibility when querying your data\. After you create a secondary index on a table, you can read data from the index in much the same way as you do from the table\.

DynamoDB supports two kinds of indexes:
+ Global secondary index ‚Äì An index with a partition key and sort key that can be different from those on the table\.
+ Local secondary index ‚Äì An index that has the same partition key as the table, but a different sort key\.

Each table in DynamoDB has a quota of 20 global secondary indexes \(default quota\) and 5 local secondary indexes\.

In the example *Music* table shown previously, you can query data items by *Artist* \(partition key\) or by *Artist* and *SongTitle* \(partition key and sort key\)\. What if you also wanted to query the data by *Genre* and *AlbumTitle*? To do this, you could create an index on *Genre* and *AlbumTitle*, and then query the index in much the same way as you'd query the *Music* table\.

The following diagram shows the example *Music* table, with a new index called *GenreAlbumTitle*\. In the index, *Genre* is the partition key and *AlbumTitle* is the sort key\.


| Music Table | *GenreAlbumTitle* | 
| --- | --- | 
|  <pre><br />{<br />    "Artist": "No One You Know",<br />    "SongTitle": "My Dog Spot",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "Hey Now",<br />    "Price": 1.98,<br />    "Genre": "Country",<br />    "CriticRating": 8.4<br />}                               <br />                                </pre>  |  <pre><br />{<br />    "Genre": "Country",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "Hey Now",<br />    "Artist": "No One You Know",<br />    "SongTitle": "My Dog Spot"<br />}<br />                                </pre>  | 
|  <pre><br />{<br />    "Artist": "No One You Know",<br />    "SongTitle": "Somewhere Down The Road",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "Somewhat Famous",<br />    "Genre": "Country",<br />    "CriticRating": 8.4,<br />    "Year": 1984<br />}<br />                                </pre>  |  <pre><br />{<br />    "Genre": "Country",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "Somewhat Famous",<br />    "Artist": "No One You Know",<br />    "SongTitle": "Somewhere Down The Road"<br />}<br />                                </pre>  | 
|  <pre><br />{<br />    "Artist": "The Acme Band",<br />    "SongTitle": "Still in Love",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "The Buck Starts Here",<br />    "Price": 2.47,<br />    "Genre": "Rock",<br />    "PromotionInfo": {<br />        "RadioStationsPlaying": {<br />            "KHCR",<br />            "KQBX",<br />            "WTNR",<br />            "WJJH"<br />        },<br />        "TourDates": {<br />            "Seattle": "20150622",<br />            "Cleveland": "20150630"<br />        },<br />        "Rotation": "Heavy"<br />    }<br />}<br />                                </pre>  |  <pre><br />{<br />    "Genre": "Rock",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "The Buck Starts Here",<br />    "Artist": "The Acme Band",<br />    "SongTitle": "Still In Love"<br />}<br />                                </pre>  | 
|  <pre><br />{<br />    "Artist": "The Acme Band",<br />    "SongTitle": "Look Out, World",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "The Buck Starts Here",<br />    "Price": 0.99,<br />    "Genre": "Rock"<br />}<br />                                </pre>  |  <pre><br />{<br />    "Genre": "Rock",<br />    "AlbumTitle": "The Buck Starts Here",<br />    "Artist": "The Acme Band",<br />    "SongTitle": "Look Out, World"<br />}<br />                                </pre>  | 

Note the following about the *GenreAlbumTitle* index:
+ Every index belongs to a table, which is called the *base table* for the index\. In the preceding example, *Music* is the base table for the *GenreAlbumTitle* index\.
+ DynamoDB maintains indexes automatically\. When you add, update, or delete an item in the base table, DynamoDB adds, updates, or deletes the corresponding item in any indexes that belong to that table\.
+ When you create an index, you specify which attributes will be copied, or *projected*, from the base table to the index\. At a minimum, DynamoDB projects the key attributes from the base table into the index\. This is the case with `GenreAlbumTitle`, where only the key attributes from the `Music` table are projected into the index\.

You can query the *GenreAlbumTitle* index to find all albums of a particular genre \(for example, all *Rock* albums\)\. You can also query the index to find all albums within a particular genre that have certain album titles \(for example, all *Country* albums with titles that start with the letter H\)\.

## DynamoDB Streams<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.Streams"></a>

DynamoDB Streams is an optional feature that captures data modification events in DynamoDB tables\. The data about these events appear in the stream in near\-real time, and in the order that the events occurred\.

Each event is represented by a *stream record*\. If you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record whenever one of the following events occurs:
+ A new item is added to the table: The stream captures an image of the entire item, including all of its attributes\.
+ An item is updated: The stream captures the "before" and "after" image of any attributes that were modified in the item\.
+ An item is deleted from the table: The stream captures an image of the entire item before it was deleted\.

Each stream record also contains the name of the table, the event timestamp, and other metadata\. Stream records have a lifetime of 24 hours; after that, they are automatically removed from the stream\.

You can use DynamoDB Streams together with AWS Lambda to create a *trigger*‚Äîcode that runs automatically whenever an event of interest appears in a stream\. For example, consider a *Customers* table that contains customer information for a company\. Suppose that you want to send a "welcome" email to each new customer\. You could enable a stream on that table, and then associate the stream with a Lambda function\. The Lambda function would run whenever a new stream record appears, but only process new items added to the *Customers* table\. For any item that has an `EmailAddress` attribute, the Lambda function would invoke Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\) to send an email to that address\.

**Note**  
In this example, the last customer, Craig Roe, will not receive an email because he doesn't have an `EmailAddress`\.

In addition to triggers, DynamoDB Streams enables powerful solutions such as data replication within and across AWS Regions, materialized views of data in DynamoDB tables, data analysis using Kinesis materialized views, and much more\.
